# Academy-of-Legends

Academy of Legends aims to enhance classroom engagement by delivering a gamified, interactive learning experience tailored for teachers and students in grade 8 and under. By using gaming elements, students can participate in a solo/team-based environment, making learning more enjoyable, and providing real-time feedback on student progress.
